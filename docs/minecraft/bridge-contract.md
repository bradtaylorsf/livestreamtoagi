# Bridge message contract (E4-2)

The Python<->Node bridge (epic #506) uses **one versioned message contract** so
the Node Minecraft bots and the Python backend cannot drift. This is issue
#541's deliverable; the transport/envelope rules it implements are fixed by ADR
[`docs/decisions/0010-bridge-protocol.md`](../decisions/0010-bridge-protocol.md)
(E4-1, the source of truth).

## Single source of truth

`core/bridge/contract.py` holds the Pydantic v2 models. **Python validates with
those models; Node validates with a JSON Schema *generated from* them.** The
Node-side artifact is committed at
`core/bridge/schemas/bridge-protocol.schema.json` and is never hand-edited —
regenerate it after any contract change:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/export_bridge_schemas.py          # rewrite the schema
.venv/bin/python scripts/export_bridge_schemas.py --check   # CI-style staleness check
```

The export is deterministic (sorted keys, trailing newline) so a stale
committed schema is a hard test failure, not a silent divergence.

## Envelope

Every message is one of two envelopes, with the exact field set ADR §2 fixes
(`extra='forbid'` — unknown fields are rejected, not ignored):

- **`BridgeRequest`** — `version`, `request_id`, `agent_id`, `run_id`,
  `simulation_id`, `service`, `method`, `payload`, `deadline_ms`,
  `cost_context`, `trace_id`. Node->Python, or Python->Node for control
  messages.
- **`BridgeResponse`** — `request_id`, `ok`, `payload`, `error`, `retryable`,
  `trace_id`. `retryable` defaults to `false` (ADR §5: absence/ambiguity is
  *not* retryable).

`trace_id` is the **E4-7 (#546)** end-to-end correlation id: optional,
defaults to `null`, an *additive* protocol-1.1 minor bump (ADR §3) — a 1.0
peer that omits it stays wire-compatible. The server echoes the caller's
`trace_id` or mints one when absent, so a single request is traceable across
both the Node and Python logs by one id.

`payload` is opaque at the envelope level and validated per-verb via
`SERVICE_REGISTRY`.

## Versioning (fail-closed)

`PROTOCOL_VERSION = "1.8"` (E4-7 added the optional `trace_id`, E5-1 added
optional core-memory fields, E6-5 added `code.execute`, E6-6 added typed
perception snapshot definitions, E7-2 added `errand.poll`, and E7-3 added
`errand.complete`, E8.5-4 added `director.gate`, and E11-5 added
`kill.status`; all are additive minor bumps). Same-major versions are
wire-compatible in either direction (new fields/verbs are additive). An unknown
*major* — or any
unparseable version — is **not
supported**; the server replies with the exact ADR §3 shape
(`unsupported_version_response`): `ok=false`,
`error.code="unsupported_version"`, `retryable=false`. Ambiguity is rejected,
never guessed.

## Closed service set

The bridge dispatches a **closed** registry — there is no generic "run
arbitrary Python" verb. The frozen six initial verbs from issue #541 remain in
`INITIAL_VERBS`; the live registry also includes `bridge.ping` (the ADR's
`!bridgePing` first-proof round-trip) and additive service verbs such as
`code.execute` and `errand.*`:

| `service.method` | Direction | Request → Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bridge.ping` | Node↔Python | `{message}` → `{pong}` |
| `memory.recall` | Node→Python | `{query, scope, limit}` → `{results[]}` |
| `memory.write` | Node→Python | `{content, kind, metadata}` → `{memory_id}` (idempotent on `request_id`) |
| `management.review` | Node→Python | `{agent_id, text, context}` → `{verdict, reason, sanitized_text}` |
| `cost.gate` | Node→Python | `{agent_id, action, estimated_cost_usd}` → `{allowed, reason, remaining_budget_usd}` |
| `kill.status` | Node→Python | `{}` → `{active, ttl_seconds?, reason?}` |
| `perception.report` | Node→Python | `{observations[]}` → `{accepted}`; observations may include a typed `PerceptionSnapshot` |
| `action.result` | Node→Python | `{action_id, status, outcome_class?, detail}` → `{accepted}` |
| `errand.poll` | Node→Python | `{agent_id}` → `{task_id?, task?, from_agent?, dispatched_at_ms?, urgency?}` |
| `errand.complete` | Node→Python | `{task_id, status, symbol, detail, step_results[]}` → `{accepted}` |
| `code.execute` | Node→Python | `{language, code, timeout?}` → `{status, stdout?, stderr?, reason?, exit_code?, execution_time_ms?}` |
| `director.gate` | Node→Python | `{agent_id, event_kind, event_text, source_agent?, mentions[], position?, scene_hint?, available_tools[]}` → `{selected, turn_kind?, reason, suppression_reason?, scene_id, scene_digest, role, local_observations, granted_tools[], build_macro?, queue_depth, suppressed_agents[]}` |

**Naming reconciliation:** issue #541's scope text says `memory.read`; ADR §6
(authoritative) calls the same verb `memory.recall`. The contract uses
`memory.recall` everywhere so the split is *closed*, not carried forward.
`cost.reserve` and `journal.event` are named in ADR §6 but their schemas land
with their owning issues — out of the current bridge registry.

## Kill switch gating (E11-5)

`kill.status` and `bridge.ping` stay ungated so bots can keep probing health and
state while the operator kill switch is active. The world/action verbs are
gated by the Python server and mirrored by the Node client's local cache:

| Verb | Active kill-switch behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `action.result`, `code.execute`, `errand.complete` | `ok=false`, `error.code="kill_switch_active"`, `retryable=true` |
| `perception.report` | safe no-op success (`{accepted: true}`) and no inbound event emit |
| `errand.poll` | safe-idle success with no task |

The documented Node propagation window is
`MINECRAFT_BRIDGE_KILL_POLL_MS` (default 2 seconds) plus at most one in-flight
bridge `deadline_ms`.

## Perception Snapshot (E6-6)

`perception.report` keeps `observations: list[dict]` for backward
compatibility with earlier pose/block/structure reports. E6-6 adds a stable
typed observation inside that list:

```json
{
  "type": "perception_snapshot",
  "pose": {
    "position": {"x": 0, "y": 64, "z": 0},
    "yaw": 0.0,
    "pitch": 0.0,
    "on_ground": true,
    "dimension": "overworld"
  },
  "nearby_blocks": [
    {"position": {"x": 1, "y": 64, "z": 0}, "block_type": "stone"}
  ],
  "entities": [
    {
      "entity_id": "mob-1",
      "kind": "mob",
      "name": "zombie",
      "position": {"x": 0, "y": 64, "z": 1},
      "distance": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "inventory": {
    "items": [{"slot": 1, "item_id": "oak_planks", "count": 4}],
    "equipment": {"hand": "stone_pickaxe", "head": null},
    "used_slots": 1,
    "total_slots": 46
  },
  "radius_blocks": 8.0,
  "scope": "all",
  "include_air": false,
  "captured_tick": 123
}
```

The Python inbound handler still emits the original `observations` list
unchanged. When a schema-valid `perception_snapshot` is present, it also adds a
normalized `snapshot` field to the `bridge_perception` event payload. Invalid
or absent snapshot observations do not reject the report; they simply omit the
additive `snapshot` field so older reports keep flowing.

## Server endpoint (E4-3)

`core/bridge/server.py` mounts the Python side of the bridge as one
authenticated FastAPI WebSocket (`bridge_router`, wired into `core/main.py`
alongside `/ws`):

```
/api/minecraft/bridge/ws
```

- **Fail-closed auth (ADR §4).** A shared-secret bearer token is read from the
  `MINECRAFT_BRIDGE_TOKEN` env var and compared with `hmac.compare_digest`
  (constant-time, mirroring `core/admin/kill_switch_routes.py`). The presented
  token normally comes from the handshake `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  header. A `?token=` query-param fallback exists only for constrained local
  clients that cannot set WS headers, and the server accepts it only when
  `MINECRAFT_BRIDGE_ALLOW_QUERY_TOKEN=1` is explicitly enabled. It is disabled
  by default because bearer tokens in URLs can leak through logs/history. An
  unset/empty server token, or a missing/malformed/wrong presented token,
  **closes the socket with code 1008 before `accept()`** — no `service` is ever
  dispatched on an unauthenticated connection. There is no anonymous or
  "auth optional in dev" path.
- **Validation order (ADR §2→§3→§6).** After `accept()`, each frame is parsed
  as a `BridgeRequest`, version-negotiated fail-closed on an unknown major, and
  validated against the closed per-verb registry. Every post-handshake failure
  comes back as a contract-valid `BridgeResponse` (`ok=false` + typed `error`)
  on a still-open socket — only the handshake closes the socket.
- **Real service vs stub dispatch.** `memory.recall`, `memory.write`,
  `management.review`, and `code.execute` require initialized FastAPI services.
  Code execution delegates to `tools/code_execution.py` and its existing
  Docker/gVisor sandbox; if those services are unavailable the bridge returns a
  retryable `code_service_unavailable` error. `management.review` (E8-7) routes
  candidate bot speech through the Management content filter out-of-band: the
  bridge handler awaits `Management.review`, preserves the severity ladder
  (including the severity-5 mute + kill-switch ladder), and returns
  `{verdict, reason, sanitized_text}` so the Node-side `openChat` gate can
  either emit the original text, emit a sanitized replacement, or stay silent.
  When the management service is unavailable the bridge returns a retryable
  `management_service_unavailable` error so the bot fails closed. `errand.poll`
  and `errand.complete` are also wired: poll drains the in-process queue
  populated by `tools/alpha_dispatch.py`, and complete records the verified
  outcome and — when the memory compactor is initialized — persists it through
  `MemoryCompactor.compact_interaction` as an `errand_outcome` event so it is
  retrievable on the same `memory.recall` path. The completion ack is
  intentionally independent of memory availability and the write is idempotent
  per `(simulation_id, task_id)`. The remaining verbs use contract-valid
  placeholders until their owning issues wire them. Each success payload is
  re-validated through `validate_response` before it goes on the wire.

## Observability (E4-7)

`core/bridge/observability.py` is the Python half of the cross-language
correlation story (issue #546). It changes **no wire contract** — only adds the
additive `trace_id` and instrumentation:

- **One trace id per request.** The server resolves a single `trace_id` for
  every settled frame — echoing the caller's, or **minting** `trace-<uuid>`
  when the (additive) field is absent — echoes it back on the
  `BridgeResponse`, and threads it into the E4-6 inbound emit. The Node client
  (`python_bridge.js`) mints/propagates the same id and the
  `!bridgePing` action tags its log lines with it, so **one request greps
  end-to-end across both languages by a single id**.
- **Structured logs.** Both sides emit one fixed `key=value` line per settled
  call — prefix `bridge_event`, `trace_id` first — Python via stdlib `logging`
  (also attached as `extra={"bridge": {...}}`), Node to **stderr** (never
  stdout — that is a data channel). Success logs at INFO, a handled failure /
  unparseable frame at WARNING.
- **In-process counters.** Calls by verb, errors by code, and a latency
  accumulator (count/sum/max, plus fixed buckets on the Python side). No
  `prometheus`/`statsd` dependency — `bridge_metrics_snapshot()` (Python) /
  `bridgeMetrics()` (Node) expose a JSON-safe snapshot a real exporter can read
  later without a contract change.

## Verifying

The contract test validates **both directions** (request + response) on **both
sides** (Pydantic *and* the committed JSON Schema via `jsonschema`) against
committed static fixtures in `tests/backend/fixtures/bridge/`, and guards
against schema drift, fail-closed versioning, and an out-of-contract verb. The
server test drives the **real endpoint** over an in-process WebSocket: every
verb round-trips a contract-valid stub, and unauthenticated/malformed-token
handshakes are rejected before dispatch. The observability test drives the
**real endpoint** with the committed Node client and asserts one `trace_id`
correlates the Node stderr logs with the Python server logs, plus the counters:

```bash
pnpm verify:bridge-contract        # .venv/bin/pytest tests/backend/test_bridge_contract.py -v
pnpm verify:bridge-server          # .venv/bin/pytest tests/backend/test_bridge_server.py -v
pnpm verify:bridge-observability   # .venv/bin/pytest tests/backend/test_bridge_observability.py -v
pnpm verify:embodiment-code-execution
pnpm verify:embodiment-perception
```

This bridge contract/perception path has **no LLM runtime path** (auth/schema
plumbing, service dispatch, and bot world reads; no model calls), so no LM
Studio simulation is required for the contract itself. Contract/server tests
run headless in the existing `backend-test` CI job; the code-execution and
perception bridge paths are covered separately by
`tests/backend/test_embodiment_code_execution.py` and
`tests/backend/test_embodiment_perception.py`.
